Senior Capstone project for the UNT Comptuer Science department

Authors: Anne Sabatini, Carissa Barrett, Derek Rogers, Ryan Gerard, Sarah Richards

The project is currently in the brainstorming phase. Below is a list of possible projects to work on:

1. Let's say you want to make a tasty cocktail on an airplane with the limited supplies you have available for purchase. What if you were able to type your flight number on your phone and watch it give you a list of available ingredients that specific plane has and it gives you suggestions on what cocktails to make based on that ingredient list. To take it one step further, ideally being able to sort your options in useful ways. You could also add ingredients to the ones you have available for purchase and properly update suggestions.

2. Travel websites adjust their prices depending on the customers data. One of the major pieces of data companies use to determine price is the customer's location. We could make a service that takes a service a customer is trying to purchase, ask for that service in a variety of locations, figure out where the cheapest place to purchase that service, and help the user purchase the service at the cheapest price. We could do further research and testing to figure out other important pieces of data that commonly effect prices and add that to the application.

3. A common problem board game, card game, and table top game enthusiasts have is knowing what is going on at any given moment at their local board game shops. Many have themed nights (ie Friday night magic), but most of the time no one knows what to expect when they walk in the door. The biggest annoyance stemming from this issue is when someone wants to play a game with their friends at the shop only to find out every table is being used. There are also many missed opportunities under the current systems (or lack thereof). For example, if someone on their phone knew there were going to be people playing their favorite game at a certain time/location, they might want to ask that group of strangers if that person could join them. There are many ways an application could help bring this community closer, improve customer experience, and even give well documented data to store/business owners to help better manage their business. 

4. Photography territory manager with customer feedback. (Presented in class by a guest)

Our group all agree option 4 is a dumpsterfire. The requirements for the class is to present 3 ideas,
so currently we have atleast 3. In class Tuesdsay January 20th there will be more presentations that will
add to this list as well as more internal brainstorming.
