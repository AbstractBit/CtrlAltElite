The project Description:

  People who play board/tabletop/card games are interested in what is going on at the tables at their local board game shops. They might be looking for a free table or looking to join other people to play a game. Currently there is no way to find this out without showing up to the store and gathering this information yourself. Our application aims to find out what is happening at the tables and help people organize games or tournaments via any device with a web browser..
